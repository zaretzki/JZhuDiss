\section{Introduction}
Employee turnover is a topic that has drawn the attention of management researchers and practitioners for decades, because  employee turnover is both costly and disruptive to the functioning of most organizations \citep{staw1980, mueller1989,kacmar2006}, and both private firms and governments spend billions of dollars every year managing the issue according to \citet{leonard2001}. Therefore, the objectives of this study is
1) predict the probability that an individual will retire in a certain window and/or time until retirement (Mean residual life).
2) Predict aggregate numbers of retirements in a fixed time frame at the or division level to facilitate plannning.
3) To determine the impact of internal and external economic variables on retirement.
4) Quantifying the effect of a buyout policy.
As a funded research project, a large organizational secondary dataset including 12-year employees demographic information and records is transformed, analyzed and modeled by Cox proportional hazard regression models with a time dependent covariate using competing risks analysis to examine the statistically significant factors and to predict employees' conditional retiring probabilities. This study also examines the forecasting capability of Cox proportional hazard model on the data with two kinds of bias (left truncation and right censor) by simulation.


%Employee turnover cost impacts both the operational capabilities and the budget of an organization. The cost for turnover involves recruiting, selecting, training and developing \citep{mobley1982, staw1980}. According to the estimation from U.S. Department of Labor, turnover costs a company one third of a new hire's annual salary to
%replace an employee, which is about \$500 to \$1500 per person for fast-food industry and \$3000 to \$5000 per person for trucking industry \citep{white1995}. Furthermore, turnover also disrupts the social and communication structures, and causes the productivity loss due to the replacement \citep{mobley1982}. Beyond the these cost and operational disruption, turnover demoralizes the attitudes of remaining employees and leads to additional turnover \citep{staw1980}. Therefore, understanding and forecasting turnover at firm and departmental levels is essential for reducing it \citep{kacmar2006} and for effective planning, budgeting, and recruiting in the human resource field.

%this study is to forecast employee turnover in organizational level using time series and individual level using survival analysis, to examine the internal and external factors contributing on employee turnover, to identify why employee turnover, and to measure the effect of human resource policy on employee turnover based on employee demographic dataset.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Survival analysis application}
Survival analysis is widely used to analyze lifetime data in many areas, such as medical health, business,and reliability area.
\citet{claus1991} investigated the familial risk of breast cancer in a large population-based, case-control study using recurrent life time analysis. The effect of genotypon the risk of breast cancer is illustrated as a function of a woman's age. The carriers of the allele appear to be at greater risk at all ages compared with non-carriers. And the specific risks is greatest at young ages and declines steadily thereafter. 
\citet{de1999} applied a parametric mixture model to survival rates of colon cancer patients from the Finnish population-based  cancer registry. The study divided survival into two different components to effectively perform the analysis and to interpret the role of prognostic factors on survival patterns. The studies found that age plays a different role in determining the probability of cure and life expectancy of fatal cases. 
\citet{lu2002} applied survival analysis techniques to predict customer churn by using data from a telecommunications company. The study helped the companies understand customer churn risk and hazard by predicting which customers will churn and when they will churn. Their study provided a tool for telecommunication companies to make retention plan to reduce the customer churn.
\citet{braun2011} used a hierarchical competing risks analysis to model when and why customers terminate their service by using the data from a provider of land-based telecommunication services. Their study focused on three mainly causes: value (price), personal, non-pay or abuse. %The data was is divided as two parts calibration and holdout ranging from January 2007 to June, 2008 with right censored. 
This study provided a tool for assistant market manager to target their customers and to determine retention strategies to prevent or delay the customer churn due to different causes.
%Technical Literature - predictive models and survival. 
\citet{carrion2010} estimates the time to failure of the pipes in water supply network dataset under left-truncation and right-censoring (2000-2005) by using the extend Nelson estimator (ESE) developed by Pan and Chappell \citeyearpar{pan1998}. The Cox regression model is applied into the data to identify the factors / covariates which affect the reliability for the water supply network. The result shows that the materials of the water pipe, length, and diameter of the pipe section and road traffic conditions are all significant. %The final model is built and verified by the Cox-snell, Scaled Schonenfeld, {\it dfbeta} and Deviance residuals. 
%\citet{royston2013} describe validation methods to evaluate Cox regression (prognostic) model performance based on external dataset. The prognostic model are necessary to be evaluated before applying to the medical area. This study built the cox prognostic model by the breast cancer dataset from Roterdam tumor bank and then it provided three levels evaluation to validate the model by the external dataset from German Breast Cancer Study Group: (1) changes in prediction index for the validation dataset, (2) the prediction index for four risk groups combined with Kaplan-Meier curves, and (3) the prediction performance for the four risk groups according to the survival baseline generated from cox regression model. The paper applied seven methods to evaluate the model in validation dataset: prediction index using regression in validation dataset, check model misspecification/fit using offset, using Harell c-index, Gonon \& Heller K and explained variation to measure model discriminations, comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves for four risk groups, log rank or Cox test between risk groups, hazard ratio comparison among four groups, and  the prediction of the mean values and the predicted mean survival curves comparison by Kaplan-Meier curves. The result shows the model also has a reasonable performance in the validation dataset. It proved that these validation methods can be applied in many areas as a tool to evaluate the reliability for cox regression models.
\section{Data Preparation}
%objective is to forecast employee retirement and voluntarily quit using statistical model\\
%1. data description \\
%a. The data is employee demographic information and records windows 10 years, data's detailed information. \\
The turnover dataset is a large real world secondary dataset from a multipurpose research organization in the U.S. The dataset consists 4316 current active and 3782 terminated full-time employees' information including metrics such as payroll category, hired date, company start date, company credit service date, termination date, age at hired , years of service at hired (YCSH), gender, job classification (named as Cocs code), and Organization level (named as division). The company credit service date is the date that the organization starts to credit their retirement plan. Years of service (YCS) is the total years credit for employees' pension plan. The employees are eligible to get a full pension, when their age is at least 65 or their points is greater than 85, which is the sum of age and year of service. Employees have different YCS when they are hired because their YCS can be transferred from their previous job if their previous job also accounts for the pension plan. %Some employees do not have pension plan when they were hired but they got pension later, so their company credit service date was later than hired date.
Common Occupational Classification System (COCS) code is a standardized code used to describe the job category by the organization for reporting to Common Occupational Classification System. In this study, COCS code is highly correlated with payroll category: managers, engineers, administrative, and scientists are monthly payroll, general administrative and technicians are weekly payroll, the other categories are hourly payroll.
Organization level code is used to distinguish the departments. In this study, the division in the organization do not stabilize like COCS code for an employee, because the division can be renamed, reduced, or dismissed by the change of production plan or organization's budget. The division is considered as time independent variable for employees due to no historical record for divisions provided by HR department.

The window of time for the turnover dataset is from November 2000 to December 2012, i.e. the dataset consists the records only for the employees working in the organization from November 2000 to December 2012, indicating there is no records for employees leaving the organization before November 2000 and no termination date for 4316 current employees. These two kinds of unknown information cause two kinds of bias: right censor and left truncation. The right censor is due to the no termiation date for current employees, and the left truncation is due to no records for employee leaving before November 2000.

In the organization, all the employees hired before January 2012 are eligible for define benefit retirement plan. That organization started to use 401k retirement plan for part of new employees from January 2012. The two requirements for getting the full define benefit retirement plan are either a employee is at least 65 years old, or their points reach 85. The points is the summation of age and credit years of service.

%The turnover dataset is split into two datasets: training and holdout dataset. The training part is used to build the model  and the holdout part is to validate the model performance. Two methods are used to slipt the dataset in order to validate the model performance: One is split data by a time point November 1 2010: training (November 1, 2000 - October 31, 2010) and holdout (November 1st, 2010 - December 31, 2012). The other on is to random split the turnover dataset into 2/3 of the dataset as training and 1/3 of the dataset as holdout. %Age of employees is used to build the model as dependent variable rather than the length of service time in the organization. The age is calculated based on two time points: start age and leaving age. Start age is the age of an employee at hired in the organization, or the age at November 1st 2000, when the employee was hired before November 1st, 2000; leaving age is the age at the date who left the organization or the age at October 31st 2010, if the employee was still working in the organization at that time which are treated as censored data.
The covariates identified from the turnover dataset and used to build the models are payroll, gender, division, cocs code (Job category), age at hired, and year of service at hired:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Payroll (PR): hourly, weekly, or monthly payroll,
	\item Gender: male, female
	\item division (ORG): ten divisions in the organization.
	\item Cocs code: Crafts(C), Engineers (E), General Administrative (G), Laborers (L), General Managers (M),  Administrative (P),  Operators (O), Scientists (S), Technicians (T))
	\item Age at hired: most recent age when an employee is hired.
	%\item Age at started: the age of an employee at November, 2000, if employee hired before November, 2000, or the age of an employee at hired, if employee hired after November, 2000.
	\item Years of service at hired (YCSH): the years of service which accounts for pension plan when employee is most recently hired.
	%\item Termination date: the date when an employee left the organization.
	%\item Termination type: the reasons for employees leaving the organization, such as retirement(RE),  volunteer quit (VQ), and other reasons.
	%\item Age at end: the age of an employee at termination date, if employee left the organization before October 31th, 2010, or the age of an employee at October 31th, 2010.
	
\end{itemize}

%2. economic indicator variables, sources and what they are, why you select these economic index\\
Several economic indices are being considered and tested their as a variable impact on employee turnover. These indices include unemployment index, housing price index (HPI), investment index, and marketing index. Seasonal adjusted unemployment rate is published by Bureau of Labor Statics from United department of Labor \citep{unemployment}. U.S housing price index, U.S. and southeastern monthly purchase-only index are considered as another economic indicator variables in the study \citep{HPI}. S\&P 500 indices published from S\&P Dow Jones Indices are also considered as investment index including S\&P 500, Dividend, Earnings, Consumer index, Long Interest Rate, Real Price, Real Dividend, Real Earnings, P/E 10 ratio \citep{sp500}. Wilshire 5000 total market full cap index published by Wilshire Associates is considered as market index in the forecasting model\citep{will5000}. All these twelve indices are treated as variables using their twelve-month lag term in yearly data format. All these indices selected are indicators in various economic areas, such as job market, house market, and stock market, representing the fluctuation of these economic areas. The economic indices are originally in the dayly or monthly form. The average values by  twelve month for each year are used into the model fitting.

\section{Model Development and Evaluation}
Several questions have to be addressed by this study: Can turnover in term of retirement or voluntary quit be predicted? When will a employees turnover? Who will retire or voluntary quit in term of job categories or divisions? what age groups are more likely to retire or voluntary quit? What economic conditions related to retirement or voluntary quit? What is the magnitude or impact of buyout program? How do the tenure and age impact the retirement or voluntary quit? Besides, how to deal with the data biases: right censor and left truncation existing in the dataset. All these questions and problems can be solved by lifetime analysis, also called survival analysis. The survival analysis is to analyze the time duration for the occurrence of an events or certain events. The events can be the death of the patients, the failure of the machine, and the leaving of the employees by any reasons for this study. There are two kinds of survival statistic models: parametric survival models and Cox proportional hazards (PH) models. In this study, Cox PH model is employed to build the forecasting model, to generate a employees' working life baseline (distribution), and to identify significant factors for turnover. The parametric models are not appropriate for this study, because it is hard to fit the employees' working life distribution to any parametric distributions, such as Weibull or log-normal distribution. Time dependent covariates are incorporated for fitting the 2008 intervention event due to the downsize policy in the organization and for examining the effects of economic indicators. Competing risks analysis is applied for modeling employee retirement and voluntary quit. Besides, A simulation study is performed to examine the forecasting capability of cox proportional hazard model on the left truncation and right censor dataset.
 %There are several reasons for employee leaving the organization: retirement, voluntary quit, layoff, transferring, leave of absence, or death. In this study, retirement and voluntary quit are selected and modelled respectively using competing risks analysis.
 \subsection{Two data bias: right censor and left truncation}
 % what is right censor, how to deal with right censor\\
 % what is left truncation how to deal with left truncation\\
 Right censor and left truncation are common in survival analysis. The right censor is that the event of interest (failure) occurs after the study window.
 \begin{figure}[htbp]
 	\centering
 	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{fig1.png}
 	\caption{Right censor and left truncation}
 	\label{fig:1}
 \end{figure}
  Let $T$ denotes the time of main event of interest to occur and let $C$ denotes the end time of study. An observation is right censored when $T> C$, indicating the study do not have the failure time of the right censored observation. In this study, the study window is from November 2000 to December 2012 as shown in the figure \ref{fig:1}. Thus, the current active employees have unknown terminated date. They are treated as right censor. These right censored observations require special treatment in survival analysis: a censor indicator variable is created:
 \begin{align*}
 	\delta_i&=
 	\begin{cases}
 		1   &\text{if  }  t_i \leq c_i \text{ (uncensored),}\\
 		0   &\text{if  }  t_i > c_i \text{ (censored),}
 	\end{cases}
 \end{align*}
 where, $i$ denotes the ith observation, and the failure time of event for ith observation is minimum time between $t_i$ and $c_i$, i.e., $min(t_i, c_i)$, that is when $ c_i <t_i $, $c_i$ is taken as end time of the ith observation in order to do next  analysis.

 Left truncation is that the occurrence of an intermediate event prior to the event of interest appear in the sample dataset. Let $T$ denotes the time of event of interest to occur and let $X$ denotes the time an individual enters the study, that is time of truncation events occurs. Only the individuals with $T \geq X$ are observed in the study window. Left truncation in this study occurs due to no records for employees leaving the organization before November 2000 as unobserved events shown in the figure \ref{fig:1}. The left truncation leads to another bias. As shown in the figure \ref{fig:1}, the longest arrow represents a life span for an employee hired in 1950 and left in 2006. Those employees who remain in the study window increase the apparent lifetimes. The existence of truncation in the data must be taken into account in order to overcome this bias and to achieve accurate estimation of survival analysis \citep{carrion2010}. Let $t_{i0}$ denotes the start time of the ith observation, i.e., hired time or age at hired of ith employee, $x_{i}$ denotes the entry time of the ith observation, i.e., the start time of study (November 1st, 2000) or age at November 1st, 2000. The start time of the observation is maximum value between $t_{i0}$ and $x_i$, that is when $t_{i0} < x_i $, $x_i$ is taken as start time of the ith observation in order to eliminate the left truncation bias \citep{allison1995}. The number of failures in the $t_j$ is redefined for left truncation. When $x_i < t_j \le t_i$, the observation is in the risk set. When $t_{j} < x_i \le t_i$, the ith observation has not entered study yet at $t_j$ and it cannot be considered in the risk set. When $x_i \le t_i < t_j$, it indicates the ith observation whose failure time before $t_j$, and it cannot be considered in the risk set at time $t_j$ neither \citep{carrion2010}.

% simulation study.

\subsection{Cox PH regression model}
%   1. what is cox ph regression model.
Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression is a widely used method for estimating survival life events, introduced in a seminal paper by \citet{cox1972}. The Cox PH model is usually taken the form of hazard model formula as shown in the equation \ref{eq:cox}:
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:cox}
   h(t,x)=h_0(t)e^{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_ix_i)}
   \end{equation}

   where $x=(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k)$, $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard occurring when $x=0$, $\beta$ is the coefficients of $x$.
%    why not parametric. baseline cannot fit to any parametric model\\
%    2. cox regression without/ with time dependent variable\\
   The model provides a hazard expression at time t for an individual with a given specification of a set of explanatory variables denoted by the $x$. The Cox PH formula is the product of quantities at hazard time $t$: $h_0 (t)$ as the baseline hazard function and the exponential expression to the linear combination of $\beta_i x_i$, $x$ does not involve time $t$, so it is time-independent covariates. $x$ can also be time-dependent covariates, which named extended Cox PH regression as discussed in the section \ref{sec:coxt}. The key assumption for Cox PH regression model is proportion hazards. However, Cox regression can handle non proportional hazards using time-dependent covariate or stratification.
   The Cox PH regression is "robust" and popular, because the baseline hazard function $h_0 (t)$ is an unspecified function and its estimation can closely approximate correct parametric model \citep{kleinbaum1998}. Taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation, the Cox PH model is rewritten in the equation \ref{eq:coxlog}:
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:coxlog}
   \log{h(t,x)}=\alpha(t)+\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_ix_i
   \end{equation}
   where $\alpha(t)=\log{h_0(t)}$. If $\alpha(t)=\alpha$, the baseline is exponential distribution. In the Cox PH regression, $\alpha(t)$ do not limited on specific parametric distributions and it can take any form. The partial likelihood method is used to estimated $\beta$ coefficients of the Cox model without having to specify the baseline \citep{allison1995}. The Cox PH model is performed by SAS.


\subsection{Time dependent covariate and counting process}
\label{sec:coxt}
A time dependent covariate is that a covariate is not constant through the whole study and its value changes over the course of the study. The extended Cox PH regression model incorporates both time-independent and time-dependent covariates as shown in the equation \ref{eq:timecovar}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:timecovar}
h(t,x)=h_0(t)e^{(\sum_{i=1}^{k_1}\beta_ix_i+\sum_{j=1}^{k_2}\gamma_jx_j(t))}
\end{equation}
where $x=(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{k_1}, x_1(t), x_2(t), \ldots, x_{k_2}(t))$, $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard occurring when $x=0$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the coefficients of $x$.
There are two time dependent covariates in this study: policy and economic indicators. Policy is to handle the downsizing policy issued in January 2008 with three months response time window to accommodate a voluntary reduction in force from the organization. Policy is a dummy variable across years:
\begin{align*}
Policy&=
\begin{cases}
1   &\text{if employee works in year 2008,}\\
0   &\text{if  employee does not work in year 2008.}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

%What is counting process.   \\
Counting process method in SAS programming statements is used to handle time dependent covariates, which is each employee have multiple records. Each record is related to a time interval and the covariates in this record remain constant.
Therefore, Each employee has up to 3 records: before 2008, in-between 2008, and after 2008. Two variables, age, year of service, are used for repenting two time terminals of each interval or record. For age, one time point is age at beginning of the certain period, named "age at start"; and the other one is age at end of the curtain period, named "age at end".
    Two year of services points are also generated for each record: one is year of service at the beginning of the period, named "YCS at start"; the other one is the year of service at the end of the period, named "YCS at end".\\

Economic indicators is another time dependent covariates. Because economic indicators are fluctuated across the year, all the employees have up to 12 years records based on the calender year, which interval starts from hired date or January 1, and ends at terminated date or December 31 of certain year during the study window as shown in equation . The economic indicators are taken the average value for each year into the optimal model identified from the internal covariates to examine their impacts on turnover.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:interval}
\begin{split}
(\text{start point}, \text{end point})= (max(\text{hired date}, \text{January 1 of a certain year}),\\
                                        min(\text{terminated date}, \text{December 31 of a certain year}))
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Stratification model}
%I. what is stratification model;\\
An alternative for handling nonproportional hazards is stratification.  A stratified model allows each subgroup of data as defined by a grouping variable to have its own baseline hazard while sharing parameters for other covariates across. If the proportional hazards assumption holds within these subgroups then this model allows us to get valid common estimates of covariate effects using all of the observations. Equation \ref{eq:strata} below represents the hazard function for strata {\it z};
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:strata}
	h(t,x,z)=h^z_0(t)e^{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_ix_i)}
\end{equation}
where $z$ represents the grouping variable, and $h^z\sigma_0(t)$ is a baseline hazard based for stratam z and $\beta_i$ are common effects of covariates ac. Note that the strata covariates cannot be the covariates in the Cox PH model.

%II. how to select a stratify variable\\
The proportional hazard assumption can be tested using Schoenfeld residuals which works even if the model includes time-dependent covariates; see \citet{allison2010,collett2015}. An alternative is to test the interaction between time-dependent and time-independent covariates in the Cox PH model. The assumption is valid if the interaction is not statistically significant ($P>0.05$).  Including a stratified covariate, when appropriate, can improve the Cox model's performance.  The C-statistic is used to compare models with and without stratification with a higher C value indicating a better model \citep{lemke2012}.

\subsection{Competing risks}
%  what is competing risks. competing ricks can help forecasting employee retirement and voluntary quit. \\
%  why select these two reasons to model.\\
  A competing risk is an event whose occurrence either precludes the occurrence of the event of interest or fundamentally alters the probability of occurrence of this event of interest \citep{tableman2003}. For example, turnover causes of an employee are exclusive and independent, i.e. an employee can experience only one event such as voluntary quit rather than retirement. This alters the probability of experiencing the event of interest, like retirement. Such events are known as competing risks events where one event of several different types of possible events can occur and hence the survival analysis for each event is calculated separately with the other events set as censored. Two mutually exclusive causes: retirement and voluntary quit are considered as the event of interests for each employees in this study, and the other events are treat as censored.

  There are several reasons for selecting these two causes. One main reasean is because the organization are interested in forecasting the turnover of retirement and voluntary quit. There are $1/3$  employees in that organization are over 50 years old who are eligible for retirement. The employee who voluntary quit usually is the one organization would like to keep \citep{allen2010}. And also voluntary quit costs highly for the organizations and firms \citep{selden2000}. Finally, the other reasons of turnover, such as layoff, transfer, death, or disability are caused by the factors which occurrence are random and hard to predict. The Cox PH regression for competing risks as shown in equation \ref{eq:competing}:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:competing}
  h_j(t,x)=h_{j0}(t)e^{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_{ij}x_i)}
  \end{equation}
  where, $x_{j}$ is the covariate for a specific type of turnover. Note that the coefficient $\beta$ is the effects of the covariates may be different from different turnover types. If $\beta_{ij}$  is the same for all j, the model simplified to Cox PH model as shown in equation \ref{eq:cox}.


\subsection{Variable selection}
All the covariates are putting into Cox PH regression model and selected by manually backwards selection method based on $P<0.05$.  The variable selection procedure is as follow: first, all the covariates are used to build the model. Second, remove the non-significant variable ($P>0.05$) with the largest P value, and rerun the model with the other variables. Then, repeat the second step until there is no significant variable remaining in the model.
\subsection{Model evaluation and comparison}
%\subsubsection{Measurements}
%AIC, BIC, MAPE, c statistic.\\

The Cox PH model is evaluated by four statistics criteria:  Akaike’s information (AIC), Schwartz’s Bayesian criterion (SBC), C-statistics, and mean absolute percentage value (MAPE). The optimal model should have low AIC, SBC, and MAPE value, and high C-statistics for both training and holdout dataset. In this study, the model performance on holdout dataset is considered more important than that on the training dataset.  AIC and SBC are both information criteria using likelihood value. Usually, the best model comes with lowest AIC or SBC values. AIC, SBC values are automatically generated by the models.

C-statistics or the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is to test whether the probability of predicting the outcome is better than chance. It ranges from 0.5 to 1.  Models are considered acceptable when the C-statistic is higher than 0.7 \citep{hosmer2013}. C-statistics are calculated by using the predicted failure probability compared with the actual outcomes by SAS proc logistic. The predicted failure (retirement or voluntary quit) probability is actually the conditional failure probability for an employee at time $t_j$, given that the employee is active at time $t_{j-1}$. It is calculated based on the baseline and coefficients from Cox PH models for both training and holdout dataset as shown in equation \ref{eq:prob}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:prob}
\begin{split}% to allgin the equation
P\{t_{j-1}<T<t_j\} &=1-P\{T>t_j|T \ge t_j\}\\
&=1-\frac{S_{t_j}}{S_{t_{j-1}}}   \\
&=1-\frac{{S_0(t_j)}^{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_ix_i)}}{   {S_0(t_{j-1})}^{(\sum_{i=1}^{k}\beta_ix_i)}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where, $T$ is survival time, $t_j$ is a specific value for $T$, $S_0(t)$ is the baseline function generated by Cox PH model, $x$ is the covariates, and $\beta$ is the coefficient.

MAPE is another measure for comparing the accuracy of the model fitting between different forecast models since it measures relative performance \citep{chu1998} as shown in the equation \ref{eq:mape}.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:mape}
	MAPE=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left | \frac{y_t-\hat{y_t}}{y_t} \right |\frac{1}{n}\%
\end{equation}
MAPE is calculated by using the yearly actual and predicted retirement or voluntary quit number as $y_t$ and $\hat{y_t}$, respectively.
The predicted retirement or voluntary quit number is the expected retirement or voluntary number summarized by aggregating all the failure probabilities for the active employees in the risk set at $t_j$ as shown in \ref{eq:expturnover}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:expturnover}
E(\text{turnover number at } t_j)=\sum_{i=1}^k{P_i\{t_{j-1}<T<t_j\}}
\end{equation}
where, $i$ denotes the ith employee.
%%%%%%% need some explain for traing and holdout mape%%%%%%%%%%%
The logistic regression and time series moving average methods are also employed to compare with the  performance of Cox PH regression model by MAPE value.

 \subsection{Simulation on right censor and left truncation}

 In order to understand the performance and efficiency of the Cox PH model in right censored and left truncated data we perform a simulation study.

 Generated $n =100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, \text{and } 4000$ observations  from a Weibull regression model  with one covariate which we referred to as age.

 Age is uniformly distributed from 22 to 70 years of age, which is chosen to mimic the actual distribution of workers ages in our sample.

 In the regression model, the coefficients for $\beta_{age} = -.025$ (Why?) and the coefficient for $\beta_0 = 1.5$.

 The survival times $T_i$ are randomly generated from a Weibull distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\lambda$, where $\alpha=1.5$ and $\lambda=exp(-0.025age+\beta_0)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$.


% The simulation is used to examine Cox PH model predictive performance with right censor and left truncation. The simulated lifetime data is generated based on the Weibull distribution. %The hazarld function for Weibull regression model with shape parameter $\alpha$, scale parameter $\lambda$, and covariate $X$ is shown in equation \ref{eq:weibul}, given $h_0=\alpha(\lambda)^\alpha t^{\alpha-1}$:
 %\begin{equation} \label{eq:weibul}
 %\begin{split}% to allgin the equation
 %h(t|X) & =h_0(t)exp(\beta X) \\
 %         &=\alpha (\lambda (exp(\beta X)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}})^\alpha t^{\alpha-1} \\
 %         &=\alpha(\tilde{\lambda} )^\alpha t^{\alpha-1}
 %\end{split}
 %\end{equation}
 %where, $\tilde{\lambda}=\lambda (exp(\beta X)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$.
% The simulation can be described as follows. The sample size was n=100, 300, 500, 1000, and 4000, with one variable $X$, named Age, which follows uniform distribution with parameter $a$ $(a=22)$ and $b$ $(b=70)$. Only one variable age is used in simulation process to make the estimation procedure simple and close to real world. The coefficient $\beta_{age}$ is taken $-0.025$ and $\beta_0=1.5$.
%Then, the survival time $T$ is random generated for each observation based on Weibull distribution with shape parameter $\alpha$ and scale parameter $\lambda$, where $\alpha=1.5$ and $\lambda=exp(-0.025age+\beta_0)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$.

 The simulation is performed on right censoring and left truncation separately, in order to observe the effects for different bias.
 For right censor simulation, two simulation procedure are conducted with different start points. First, the start point for all the observations are equal to 0, and stop point is equal to the survival time $t_i$ for ith observation where $T=(t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n)$. After that, the censor time $C$ is equal to first quarter, median, third quarter, and maximum of the survival time, respectively, to get 75\%, 50\%, 25\% and 0\% censor proportions. When the survival time $t_i$ for ith observation is not greater than the censor time ($c_i$), the stop point is survival time $t_i$ and censor variable $\delta_i$ is 1. When survival time $t_i$ for ith observation is greater than censor time ($c_i$), the stop point is change to censor time ($c_i$) and censor variable $\delta_i$ is 0. The second right censor simulation procedure is to set the start points $S$ to follow uniform distribution from 0 to 10, representing the observations (employees) start at various time points within 10 years study window. The stop point is equal to the summation of start point and survival time: $S+T$. The censor time is a cutoff point ($C$) identified by R to get fix number of censor proportion (25\%, 50\%, and 75\%).  When the survival time $t_i$ for ith observation is not greater than the censor time ($c_i$), the stop point is survival time $t_i$ and censor variable $\delta_i$ is 1. The stop points are set to censor time $C$ for the observations with the stop points $S+T$ being great than censor time $C$, the survival time is reset to $C-S$, and censor variable $\delta_i$ is 0. Otherwise, the other observations with stop point being less than the censor time remain the same and the censor variable $\delta_i$ is 1. For the second simulation, there are 4000 observations are generated. Because some observations occur after the cutoff point (censor time) and the sample size are various for different censor proportion, only 400 are randomly selected with 75\%, 50\%, 25\% and 0\% censor proportions to keep the sample size same. The start point and the stop point are dependent variable in the cox regression model. $\delta$ is censor variable.

 For left truncation simulation, the start point $U$ is generated as uniform distribution with $a=0$ and $b=max(T)$ which indicates an observation start randomly from time 0 to time $max(T)$. The stop point $S$ is $U+T$. The histogram is generated for $S$. The truncation time $L$ is set as 0, first quarter, median, and third quarter of $S$, respectively, to get 0\%, 25\%, 50\%, and 75\% truncation proportions. When start point $u_i$ for ith observation is less than truncation time $l_i$, the start point is reset as truncation time $l_i$. When start point $u_i$ for ith observation is not less than truncation time $l_i$, the start point does not change ($u_i$). In left truncation, the censor variable $\delta$ for all the observations are equal 1. For right censor and left truncation simulation,  the Cox regression models are modeled by "coxreg" and "phreg" function in eha package. The coxreg function is the regular cox regression modeling procedure to generate coefficient estimates and a non-parametric baseline.  The phreg funcation is using parametric distribution like Weibull, Extrem value (EV) to estimate the baseline. The "phreg" function performs Cox PH model and also provides a parametric baseline hazards estimation \citep{brostrom2012}. The phreg function is used to compare the non-parametric with parametric baseline and to demonstrate the prediction when the parametric baseline is not right.
 Total predicted failure number is calculated as shown in equation \ref{eq:prob} and \ref {eq:expturnover}. The actual and predicted failure number are compared to show right censor and left truncation's impacts on the coefficient and baseline estimation .

\section{Results}
\subsection{Right censor and left truncation simulation results}
% 1. right censor start 0 results shows in table 1a
% 2. start different results shows in table 2 and figure 2 with different baseline and prediction number
%    younger company has shorter baseline hard to predict beyond the baseline max time.
% 3. left truncation simulation results shows in table 1 and figure 4&5
% 4. shows the baseline using wrong parametric distribution (wrong) what is going on.
The right censoring simulation results are shown in the left part of Table \ref{tab:rightcensor} which all the observations start at the same time 0. The events in the second column of the table are the actual total failure events simulated without considering censoring, which is $n=100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, \text{and } 4000$. The number of events in the dataset applying to the Cox model are reduced due to the right censoring, which is equal to $events=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{\delta_i}$. The values in the other column are the average value of 100 replications for Cox PH model coefficient and baseline parameter estimates based on Weibull distribution using phreg. The simulation results show censoring proportion and the number of events are two influential factors for the coefficient estimation. The model overestimates the coefficients of age, $\lambda, \text{ and } \alpha$, when the dataset has high proportion of censoring. For example, when 75\% of the data are censored with only 25 events, the estimates for three parameters are 0.028, 4.043, and 1.564, respectively, which are the highest among all the estimates. As the event number increasing, the estimation is approaching to the actual value. For example, the estimation of age, $\lambda, \text{ and } \alpha$ are close to 0.025, 2.7, and 1.5, respectively, after the number of event is at least 500.
The predicted events in the sixth column is the total predicted failure number calculated by applying the coefficient estimates and the non-parametric baseline from Cox PH models into the dataset without considering censoring. The predicted events using censoring models are all lower than the actual total failure number, but close to the number of events after censoring. For example, the number of predicted events is 24.84 when using the estimates of Cox PH model with 75\% censoring to calculate the dataset with 100 events, which is close to 25. The prediction is less than the actual dataset, because the baseline is lack of information for the events after censored time. The baseline does not include hazards or survival probability information for the long life time observation, because the baseline just captures the events before the censor time and the observation with long life time are censored in this simulation. As a result, there is no failure probability for long life time observation.

To simulate the realistic situation, the second right censor simulation is conducted with randomly occurrence of the observations followed by uniform distribution. The results are shown in the table \ref{tab:right2}. The events without considering censoring are all equal to 400 for easy comparison. The predicted events include the prediction by non-parametric baselines using "coxreg" and by parametric baseline using "phreg" function Weibull distribution as baseline estimation. The estimation of age and $\alpha$ are all close to the simulated value (0.025 and 1.5). And the estimation of $\lambda$ are around 2.8. These indicate the right censoring does not impact the coefficients estimation. However, right censoring does impact the baseline function estimation for Cox PH model as shown in the figure \ref{fig:rightbase}. The red lines in the figure \ref{fig:rightbase} are the non-parametric baseline for 100 replications. And blue dash lines are the parametric baseline generated base on Weibull distribution for 100 replications, which represent the actual baseline. All these baselines are overlap together by various censoring, which indicates non-parametric baseline can capture the true parametric baseline. However, the duration of the non-parametric baseline is getting short by increasing the censoring proportion. As a result, the predicted number of events using non-parametric baseline is less than the actual failure number. However, it does not affect the prediction by using parametric baseline, which are all close to 400, because the parametric baseline is not limited by the baseline duration if the parameters are correctly estimated. The prediction by "coxreg" and "phreg" are plotted across time by box plot to compare to the actual failure values as shown in the figure \ref{fig:rightpred}. The vertical red line is the average value of censor time. The predicted number of events by "coxreg" are close to actual and the prediction by "phreg" before the censor time line. It is still close to actual after censor time line for the data with no censoring and with 25\% of censoring as shown in the figure \ref{fig:rightno} and \ref{fig:right25}, because of the long baseline duration. However, It drops down gradually after the censor time for the data with 50\% and 75\% of censoring as shown in figure \ref{fig:right50} and \ref{fig:right75}, because the baseline duration ends around censor time. This simulation clearly shows the limitation of Cox PH model with
non-parametric baseline: it cannot accurate predict far beyond the duration of the longest events. Therefore, a baseline can be highly variable in the extremes leading to poor predictions. Although this simulates the real problem, the employee hiring time points are followed by uniform distribution in the real world.

The results of the left truncation bias simulation statistics are shown in the right part of table \ref{tab:rightcensor}. All the values shown are the average value for coefficient estimate of age, and baseline parameter estimates of $\lambda$ and $\alpha$ by "phreg" Weibull distribution. The last column is the total predicted number of events using non-parametric baseline by "coxreg" function. Similar as the right censor simulation result, left truncation proportion and the number of events are two key factors for coefficients estimation. As table \ref{tab:rightcensor} shown, the coefficients are overestimated when the left truncation proportion is 75\% or the number of events are less than 200. However, increasing the number of events can offset (reduce) the left truncation effects. For example, the estimates for age and $\alpha$ are all close to simulated value, when the number of events is 1000 with 75\% truncation proportion. The predicted number of events is close to the actual one as shown the green and red box in the figure \ref{fig:lefttruncation}, which is the box plot of total 2000 events simulated with 100 replication by various proportion of left truncation. The red vertical line is the average of left truncation time. It is slightly overestimated using "coxreg" non-parametric baseline by four left truncation proportions, because the baseline estimation is not affected by the left truncation. The figure \ref{fig:leftbase} clear shows the duration of non-parametric baseline are the same for four left truncation proportion. It also shows the non-parametric baselines (red lines) are overlap with parametric baseline (blue dash lines).

To further test how baseline estimation impacts on the prediction, another simulation is conducted accompanied with left truncation simulation. In the previous left truncations study, the parametric baseline using Extreme Value (EV) distribution is generated by "phreg" and predicted the number of events based on it shape and scale parameter estimation as shown in figure \ref{fig:leftbase}. Because the data is generated by Weibull distribution, the parametric baselines (green dash line) by EV are much lower than the other two baselines by all four left truncation proportions. The predicted number of events based on the EV baseline are also much lower than the actual number of events across the time as the blue box shown in the figure \ref{fig:lefttruncation}. This study shows the inaccuracy estimation of the baseline lead to poor prediction.

Therefore, accurate estimation of coefficients and the baseline are two key factors impacts the perdition of the events of the Cox PH model. The simulation test shows that the Cox PH model can accurately estimates the coefficients when events number is at least 1000 even with high proportion of censor and left truncation. The baseline is another key factor to predict the number of events. The prediction will be accurate if the parametric distribution of the baseline is known or identify the correctly. Otherwise, a wrong baseline can also deteriorate the prediction. Compared to parametric baselines, a non-parametric baseline is more robust. However, it still needs enough number of events with curtain long period to get a smoothed and long baseline to predict accurately. As a result, it is hard to accurately predict the employee turnover for a company just formed recently, or when the employee population characteristic changed, due to high proportion of censor and lack of events. Although this study has more than 50\% right censor, it still has more than 3000 events with long duration (around 50 years length).

Data descriptive statistics for categorical variables are shown in table \ref{tab:descriptive} by count and percentage. 
Two histograms of employees' retired age and points are plotted as shown in figure \ref{fig:hist}. 
Age 62 is the peak of the histogram (\ref{fig:age}), indicating that age 62 is the most frequently retiring age. The histogram also shows most retired employees retired before 70 years old. 

The point 85 is the highest frequency in retired employees as shown in figure \ref{fig:point}. Because 85 points is one of the requirements to get full defined benefit, most employees retired after they reaching 85 points.

\subsection{Retirement model without external variables}
\item Set up - what are the reference groups for the categorical variables.  Division 1 is the reference group with hazard ratio as 1. Two divisions (6 and 7) have very high hazard ratio: 8.363 and 11.405, which indicates that the employee in division 6 and division 7 are much more likely to retire than the division 1.
\item Practical Significance \& Interpretations.  Provide Hazard ratios and change in survival functions related to each variable/parameter.  Explain what the parameters mean.

The variables tested in the model are payroll, cocscode, division, gender, years of service at hire, age at start, policy, P85 (binary indicator of 85 retirement points) and the interaction term of P85 and A65. We find that gender, cocs code and payroll were not significant predictors in the presence of the other variables. These indicates employees' gender, job types, or working full time or part time does not impact on retirement.
The statistically significant factors are division, years of service at hire, age at start, policy, P85 and the interaction term of P85 and A65 in the Cox PH model as shown in the table \ref{tab:paraest.}. The reference levels of these variables are division 1, policy at 0, P85 at 0, P85*A65 at 0, 2.75 years of service at hire and 45.59 years of age, which is equal to the average age of the whole population. P85 is an indicator that a person is eligible for maximum retirement benefits and naturally this has a strong impact on the probability that a person will retire.  From a quantitative point of view, the hazard ratio is $e^{1.44} = 4.22$.  So the hazard of retirement becomes 4.22 times more likely after the person exceeds 85 points.  While not surprising, this quantification is important in predicting individual and aggregate retirement time.

Another alternative eligibility criteria occurs when individuals exceed an age of 65 years and so we would anticipate the hazard increasing at this point in an employees career.  Because the response variable in our model is age, we cannot estimate the effect of this within the proportional hazards setting because the impact is included in the baseline hazard which should increase after this point; see figure \ref{fig:basepred} (explain).  However, by including an interaction between the Age 65 and points 85 indicator, we can estimate how the impact of reaching 85 points diminishes beyond regular retirement age.  In this case, the interaction term is estimated at -1.61 leading to a decreasing effect of the 85 points criteria to $e^{1.44-1.61} = 0.84$ indicating that people that exceed both criteria actually have a reduced hazard of retiring over those have only met the Age 65 criteria.  In other words, the fact that the individual remains on the job after hitting either criteria indicates that the other criteria has less impact (or that they are intending to work longer).


Starting age(age at beginning of period).  Naturally

According to our model, retirement can also be influenced by employee's age and their years of service at the time of hiring (YCSH).  The estimates for age are -0.17. As the reference age is 45.49, it means the employee's survival probability is $S(t)^{1.19}(S(t)^{e^{0.17}})$ when the employee started age is one year younger than 45.49,  where $S(t)$ is the baseline survival probability at time t for a reference employee of average age, in the case 45.49 years old at the start of the current interval. The employee's survival probability is $S(t)^{0.84}(S(t)^{e^{-0.17}})$ for every one year increase beyond 45.49 in the employee's starting age. This indicates that at any given age, the employee who starts earlier than 45.49 years old is more likely to retire , because they have more years of service and are much likely to reach retirement requirement (85 points) earlier than the employee who starts at older age. Similar as the years of service, the employee's years of service are hiring time has positive estimates (0.019) with the hazard ratio (1.019). It leads to $S(t)^{0.98}$ of the survival probability for every one year decreasing of the employee in the reference years of service at time of hiring. On the other hand, the survival probability is $S(t)^{1.019}$ for every one year increase of the employee in the reference years of service at hiring time. This indicates that the employee who has more years of service are more likely to retire than the employee who has less years of service.


Years of service at hire.

%Need significant details about the policy.

\citet{Wang2010} review

In the fiscal year 2008, the employer in the study created a temporary early retirement buyout option. The response window for this option was 3 months although the specific details of this are unknown. In order to deal with the increased level of retirement during this period we including a time dependent indicator variable.  The coefficient for this indicator was 0.86 leading to a hazard ratio of 2.21 which indicates that, on average, an individuals hazard of retirement increased by almost 2.2 times during this period.  If more information were known about the requirements or targets of this policy, a more case specific estimate would be possible.  However, this would not effect the overall aggregate retirement estimates.  It is important to include this one-time effect in order to improve the estimates of other factors(work on this last part - why do we need to include). We further test the policy effect on the employee who are eligible for getting pension. The test results shows the policy had a significant effect for the employee who are eligible for getting the full pension benefit rather than the employee who are eligible for getting partial retirement plan as the interaction term of between policy and points 75 or points 65 are not statistically significant. The hazard ratio for the policy effect on those employee substantially increase to 15.85 from 2.21, which is more than seven times of the basic policy effect, after the model adding a interaction term of policy and points 85.

Another significant factor is division as shown in the table \ref{tab:paraest.}. As the results shows the employees in some division has positive parameter estimates which is division 6, 7 and 8. Two divisions (division 6 and 7) have very high hazard ratio: 8.46 and 11.42, which indicates that the employee in division 6 and division 7 are much more likely to retire than the employee in reference division (1). Three divisions (2, 3, and 9) have negative estimates (-0.97, -0.24, and -3.02) and the hazard ratios lower than 1 (0.38, 0.79, and 0.05), which indicates the employee in those divisions are much less likely to retire than the employee in reference division (1). Two divisions (4 and 5) are not statistically significant, which indicates that the employee in division 4 and 5 has the similar chance to retire with the employee in the reference division (1). The diversity retirement behavior among divisions might be caused by the diversity of the demographic structure, leadership, departmental function, and departmental culture,

\item Baseline - describe the features of the baseline maybe use a plot.
The baseline survival function and log hazard function are shown in figure \ref{fig:basepred}. The survival probability is 1 before age 49 as shown in figure \ref{fig:Surv}, which indicates that no employee retire before age at 49. Survival probability starts to slowly decease from age 50 to age 62. The survival probability is around 0.75 for the employee who less than 62 years old, which indicates the employee who is less than 62 years has a probability of 25\% to retire.  The slope of survival function decrease sharply and causes the survival probability steeply decreasing from 0.75 to almost 0 from age 62 to age 70, which indicates the employee are much more likely to retire from age 62 to 70. Accompany with the survival function, the log hazard ratio starts to rise up from age 62 and it steps up at age 65 as shown in figure \ref{fig:Hazard}. The trend for hazard function tend to increase by age increasing. The hazard ratio causes the employee retire probability increasing sharply.

\item prediction results

The prediction for the employee retirement is shown in the figure \ref{fig:predict}, table \ref{tab:cocscode} and \ref{tab:division}. The prediction of the model captures the fluctuation of actual retirement, and also captures the peak of the special year 2008 which is the buyout policy of workforce as shown in the figure \ref{fig:predict}. The prediction number for holdout years (2011 and 2012) are very close to the actual number, indicates the model performs well on both the training and holdout part. Besides predicting the overall retirement, the model can also provide the prediction by categories. The table \ref{tab:cocscode} and \ref{tab:division} shows the prediction by cocscode (job classification) and division for years, which is the summation of the retire probability by job classification and division, separately. As the tables shown, the predicted values are also close to the actual value by these two categories.

\subsection{Retirement model with external variables}
  Because the previous model cannot account for the time varying features of the economic indicators, we use a new counting process model with yearly interval based on calendar year to test their effects on retirement. This model has the similar parameter estimation as the selected model as shown in the right part of the table \ref{tab:paraest.}. We found three indicators are statistically significant and also improve the model forecasting due to lower MAPE and $G^2$ than the values of selected model without economic indicator, which are S\&P500, Real Earnings and Wilshire 5000 as shown in table \ref{tab:EI}. Although Real price is also statistically significant, its coefficient estimates is 0.0004 leading hazard ratio is 1, which indicate it does not impact the employee's retirement behaviors. As shown in table \ref{tab:EI}, Real earnings is the most important factor among all the indicators as it has lowest $G^2$. The test results show that it has strong impact on the retire behaviors. As shown in figure \ref{fig:real}, the fluctuation of retirement plot is corresponding with 1 year lag of the trend of Real earnings. Unadjusted Monthly Housing Price (MHP) is another influential index with the lowest MAPE value. It has significantly impacts on the retire number as it increases as shown in figure \ref{fig:MHP}. However, the retire number does not decrease coinciding with the decreasing of MHP. Two market indicators(S\&P500 and Wilshire 5000) are both significantly impact the employee retirement behavior with $>1$ hazard ratio, which indicating the employee are more likely to retire when the economics is under good condition.
